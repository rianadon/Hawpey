I'm quite lazy and don't like writing tons of code; I don't have all the time in the world.
Therefore, I used a few (well maybe more than a few) projects to aid in the development of Hawpey.

**So special thanks to the projects below that help Hawpey function:**

* Every npm package listed in [package.json](package.json) (there are too many to write out here)
* `npm`, for which without there wouldn't be npm packages
* `Node.js`, for which there wouldn't be npm nor something to run the JS programs that power Hawpey
* TypeScript, for saving me time by providing excellent autocomplete
* [Google's Material Design Specifications](https://material.google.com/), for making the website not look too terrible
* Google's [Material Icons](https://design.google.com/icons/), for making the icons on the website not look too terrible
* The [Materialize framework](http://materializecss.com), for sparing me from styling input elements and creating box shadows, and also providing nice styling for the documentation pages
* [Normalize.css](http://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/), for doing its job
* [CodeMirror](http://codemirror.net/), for creating nice code editors
* [Chart.js](http://www.chartjs.org/), for creating nice charts
* [Chart.Zoom.js](https://github.com/chartjs/Chart.Zoom.js), for enabling zooming for nice charts
* [Programming language network](http://fatiherikli.github.io/programming-language-network), which was adapted into the illustration on the automation page

* Any other project that I've missed as I'm sure I forgot one. I'm sorry and I didn't mean to do so.
